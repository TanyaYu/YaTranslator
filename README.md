# Ya Translator
This is WPF desktop application helps user to remember foregn language words. Translations are provided by Yandex Translator API https://tech.yandex.com/translate/.

# Idea
Studies show that our brain does not remember dull foreign language words, but it builds associations with emotions, feelings, memories, and things. So, the best way to remember words is in combination with a sentence or other words, which include emotional overtones in them.   

This application helps to build these bonds between words and associations to remember words very fast.
